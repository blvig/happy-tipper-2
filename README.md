? it's not working

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Custom font
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
-trying to create a default 1 person pays with option to increase to split the total by number of people. have not figured it out yet

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
-I really want to put in images for the 3 percentages and then have each one flip over to reveal the dollar amount

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I don't know how to translate what I want I want into the code so elements aren't working. Would it be helpful to create a UI in sketch and then look at that code?
